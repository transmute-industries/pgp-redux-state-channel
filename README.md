# PGP Redux State Channel

> This is experimental.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/transmute-industries/pgp-redux-state-channel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/transmute-industries/pgp-redux-state-channel)

The idea is to use OpenPGP.js and Redux to create state-channel like flows, obviously a blockchain is needed for it to be a real state channel.

If this concept is interesting, we welcome contribution.

Hoping to model griefing and judgement at some point in the future.
