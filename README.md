# PGP Redux State Channel

This is experimental.

The idea is to use openpgp.js and redux to create state-channel like flows, obviously a blockchain is needed for it to be a real state channel.

If this concept is interesting, we welcome contribution.

Hoping to model griefing and judgement tests at some point in the future.
